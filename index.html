    <p>In this game you will use abilities gained after your death to help the investigating detective solve the mystery.</br>
      Disclaimer: The detective is bad at his job he needs a lot of help ♥</br>
      Also this game is more about using the available options and using deductive reasoning to decide which order would make the most sense rather than guessing ahead

      It is the autumn of 1923, and you are on a cruise ship touring the atlantic ocean. One night, you meet a friendly stranger in the ballroom, and agree to retire to your room for afternoon tea. You are enjoying pleasant conversation and delightful food when suddenly your new friend pulls out a knife and lunges towards you. In the panic, you manage to grab your cake fork and plunge it into the man’s side in an attempt to defend yourself, but alas, as you look down you see that his knife is</br> already deep in your stomach.</br></br>
      You awaken, looking over your corpse and your murderer from above, and watch on as your killer begins to cover the evidence. He takes the fork you used from your hands, and locks it away in an inconspicuous drawer in the corner of your room. You follow him, as he returns his knife to the kitchen, where, in a rush, he leaves it in the sink amongst other dirty cutlery. Finally, he drags your body down to the Engine rooms, where he finds a storage cupboard containing a pulley system which</br> operates a revolving circuit of shelves. He stashes your body on a shelf, and maneuvers them until your body is out of sight.</br></br>
      A few hours after your grizzly murder, the ship detective is alerted of your absence from dinner. He sets out to find you, but you know that your body is hidden, as are the clues pointing to the attacker. You come to realise that your ghostly form holds a new potential you didn’t notice at first.</br></br>
      You unlock three new abilities:</br>
      The power to push something</br>
      The power to possess a moving object</br>
      The power to draw someone's attention to a specific item</br></br>
      You can use each power once per room, make sure you use them in the right order.</br>
      You have to use all your powers to get a clue
